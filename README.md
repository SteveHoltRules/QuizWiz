# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Breakdown:
Create a timer based quiz
With multiple choice questions
Displayed in a responsive website. 

I was able to create a quiz with a evaulation method that added the formatting to the page as the quiz was built. Where I got stuck was evaluating the answers based on the form-check class in bottstrap. I spent too much time trying to find the ability of filtering the answers that I ran out of time for the rest of the functions. The goal is to turn this in so that I can focus on the class material and come back to this at a later date.
